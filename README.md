# Project Background & Overview
High employee turnover is expensive and disruptive for any company. This project analyzes the workforce data of **1,470** employees to understand why people are leaving the organization. By looking at attrition (employees leaving) across departments, age groups, and education levels, HR leadership can create better strategies to keep their top talent and improve job satisfaction.

**Key Business Questions:**
* Which department and education field are experiencing the highest number of employees leaving?
* Is attrition higher among a specific age group or gender?
* Does a low job satisfaction rating in specific roles (like Sales or Lab Techs) directly lead to higher turnover?

# Data Structure Overview
The data tracks individual employee profiles and their current status within the company.

* **Source:** Kaggle Public Dataset
* **Employee Profile:** Age, Gender, Education Field, and Education Level.
* **Employment Details:** Job Role, Department, and Active/Inactive status.
* **Sentiment Data** Job Satisfaction Ratings (Scale of 1–4).

# Insights Deep Dive
### Department Analysis: R&D as the Primary Attrition Driver

# Recommendations
* **R&D Retention Program**: Conduct "Stay Interviews" in the R&D department to understand why 56% of departures are happening there.
* **Career Pathing for 25–34 Year Olds**: Since this group leaves the most, implement a clear 2-year promotion track to keep them engaged.
* **Role-Specific Support**: Improve the working conditions for Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives to raise their job satisfaction scores from Level 1 to Level 3.
